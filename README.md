# UMDAnon
Project Description: UMDAnon is an anonymous interactive web form where University of Maryland, College Park students are able to voice their concerns about the six departments; DOTS, Dining, Housing, Campus life, Academia, and Health and Wellness. Users will login with their UMD credentials, which will go through the Central Authentication Service, and either click on the button that says “Submit a Form” to make their concerns or they can click on one of the department boxes to view other comments being made about the department they click on. A representative faculty member from each department will have access to the page to keep track of all the feedback.
